The idea behind this project was to show that recursive calls can be used to display each depth of a BST.

Please see Main.java for the graphical Default Tree View after all of the inserts.

Please note the method calls displayEachTreeDepth() and displayTreeDepth() in BinarySearchTree.java.  The method displayTreeDepth() is called recursively to reach the desired depth of each branch, if such a depth exists.
